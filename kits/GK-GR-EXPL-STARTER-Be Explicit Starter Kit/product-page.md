# Be Explicit Starter Kit — Overview

When a reviewer says “be explicit,” it can mean *many* different things: more context, tighter wording, clearer scope, specific constraints, or simply a different expectation. The result is often a costly loop of revisions where nobody can point to the exact gap.

This page explains the **problem space** and the **outcomes** the paid kit is designed to support—without revealing internal materials or mechanics.

## The problem (high level)

Vague feedback is common because it’s fast to say and hard to specify. But vague feedback becomes expensive when it drives:

- Rework that doesn’t converge  
- Conflicting interpretations across roles  
- “Done” definitions that shift midstream  
- Deliverables that feel subjective to approve  
- Hidden scope that appears late

Teams usually don’t need “more effort”—they need **shared clarity**.

## Outcomes the kit helps you reach

Without prescribing any particular procedure, the paid kit is built to help you:

- Translate unclear feedback into **clear, reviewable wording**
- Make expectations visible early, before work expands
- Reduce revision cycles and review friction
- Create a consistent standard for “clear enough” across a team
- Improve handoffs between writers, designers, developers, and stakeholders

---

## Common use cases

High-level examples (no scenarios or filled templates):

- Product requirements and user stories that must be interpreted consistently
- Design reviews where feedback is subjective or contradictory
- Documentation, onboarding, and SOPs that need clearer wording
- Marketing or policy copy that keeps getting rewritten for “clarity”
- Cross-functional work where different roles assume different meanings

This repo does **not** include the underlying materials, rules, or internal logic.
