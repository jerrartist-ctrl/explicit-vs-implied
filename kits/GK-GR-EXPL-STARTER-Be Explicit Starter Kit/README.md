## What problem this solves

When people say **“be explicit,”** they often mean different things. That mismatch creates:

- Endless back-and-forth and “you know what I meant” loops  
- Rewrites that don’t satisfy the reviewer  
- Specs that look complete but still leave room for interpretation  
- Missed deadlines because clarity arrives late  
- Team frustration, misalignment, and scope creep
