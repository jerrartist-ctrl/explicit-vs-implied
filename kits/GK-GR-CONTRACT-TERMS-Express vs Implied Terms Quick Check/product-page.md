# Express vs Implied Terms Quick Check — Overview

Contracts often “work” right up until a disagreement reveals that each side was relying on a different assumption. The gap between **what’s written** and **what’s implied** is where delays, scope creep, payment disputes, and relationship damage tend to start.

**Express vs Implied Terms Quick Check** is a compact digital aid designed to help you get clearer about clause meaning and expectations—so you can reduce surprises and negotiate faster with more confidence.

## The problem space (high level)

In real-world agreements, language can be:

- Under-specified (key terms missing or loosely defined)
- Overloaded (one clause doing too many jobs)
- Context-dependent (meaning changes depending on industry practice or the relationship)
- Misaligned (the business expectation doesn’t match what the text supports)

That’s how teams end up with “we assumed X” on one side and “we never agreed to that” on the other.

## Outcomes you can expect (without how-to)

- Fewer misunderstandings during execution
- Faster internal reviews and cleaner handoffs
