# Explicit vs Implicit Costs Mini‑Toolkit — Product Page

## Overview
“Be explicit” is great advice… until you have to apply it in real life.

In projects, client work, relationships, and team decisions, *implicit* expectations can quietly become expensive. The costs typically appear later as rework, missed deadlines, tense conversations, lost trust, or commitments that don’t match reality.

This mini-toolkit is designed to help you *surface* those hidden costs early, so you can make cleaner commitments and reduce avoidable friction — without turning your life into a complicated framework.

## Outcomes (high level)
Use this when you want outcomes like:
- Clearer agreements and fewer “I thought you meant…” moments
- Less rework caused by vague requirements or assumptions
- Faster alignment on what matters (and what doesn’t)
- Better documentation of decisions and commitments
- More confident “yes / no / not yet” calls

## Common use cases
High-level only:
- Before saying yes to a request that feels underspecified
- When a project keeps drifting because expectations aren’t written down
- During client onboarding, scoping, or revisions
- When teammates disagree about responsibilities or “what was implied”
- When you need a quick way to reduce confusion in handoffs
- When you want to make a commitment that won’t surprise Future You
