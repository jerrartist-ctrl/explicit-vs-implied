# Explicit vs Implicit Costs Mini‑Toolkit

Name the hidden costs before you commit — a compact decision-support toolkit for making “be explicit” feel clear, concrete, and less stressful.

## Who it’s for
- Creators, freelancers, and small teams who keep running into “be explicit” feedback
- Product builders, project leads, and ops folks who need cleaner agreements and fewer surprises
- Anyone who wants clearer commitments without turning everything into a giant process

## What problem this solves
When something is “implicit,” the costs don’t disappear — they show up later as confusion, rework, awkward follow-ups, or broken expectations. This product helps you reduce:
- Ambiguity that leads to misalignment
- Hidden time/effort costs that only appear after you say “yes”
- Scope creep, vague deliverables, and “I thought you meant…”
- Stress from making commitments with incomplete information
- Friction in handoffs, approvals, and accountability
