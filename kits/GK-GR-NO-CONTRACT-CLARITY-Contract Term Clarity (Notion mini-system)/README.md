## Who it’s for
- Freelancers, agencies, and consultants who want fewer “but I thought…” disputes
- Product, ops, support, and community teams handling policy/terms questions
- Founders and managers who need consistent internal decisions (without reinventing the wheel)
- Anyone who has to explain “what we agreed to” clearly and calmly

---

## What problem this solves
When terms, policies, or messages get interpreted differently, you end up with:
- Scope creep and misaligned expectations
- Confusing “gotcha” conversations that waste time
- Inconsistent decisions across teammates
- Missing context when you revisit a dispute later
- Risky wording that creates avoidable friction
- Stressful escalation loops (“Can you show where that was stated?”)
