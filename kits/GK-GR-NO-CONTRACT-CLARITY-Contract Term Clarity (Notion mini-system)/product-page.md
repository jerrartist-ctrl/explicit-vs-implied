# Contract Term Clarity: Overview

Contract Term Clarity is designed for a common, costly problem: people interpret the same words differently. Whether it’s a client agreement, a policy, a support message, or a boundary-setting note, ambiguity creates friction.

This product helps you move from “arguing about what it *meant*” to **capturing what was stated, what was assumed, and what outcome you chose**—so decisions are calmer, faster, and easier to explain later.

## The problem space (high level)
Ambiguity tends to show up when:
- A term exists, but people disagree on what it covers
- Someone treats an assumption as if it were promised
- Teams make inconsistent calls across similar situations
- A decision needs to be defensible weeks/months later
- “Explicit” language gets misunderstood in everyday conversation

The result is usually delays, escalations, and preventable resentment.

---

## Outcomes you can expect
- Fewer repeated arguments and less re-litigation of old decisions
- More consistent responses across teammates
- Cleaner records of what happened and why you chose an outcome
- Faster resolution when someone asks, “Where was that stated?”
- Better internal confidence when you’re enforcing terms or policies

---

## Common use cases
(High level; no how-to.)
- Client/service scope disagreements and “I assumed it was included” conflicts
- Policy and terms clarification requests from users or customers
- Support escalations where wording is contested
- Internal alignment on messaging, boundaries, and exceptions
- Building an audit trail for recurring decision types
