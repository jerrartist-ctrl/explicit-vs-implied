# Costs Clarity Tracker — Overview

Costs Clarity Tracker is designed for people who want clearer choices without turning every decision into a research project.

It focuses on outcomes: **better tradeoffs, fewer surprises, and less “why did we agree to this?” later.**

## The problem space (high level)

A lot of “cost” is invisible until after you commit:

- Time sinks that don’t look big on day one
- Ongoing coordination and context switching
- Emotional/mental load from unfinished decisions
- Hidden dependencies that slow everything down
- The opportunity cost of what you *didn’t* choose

When these aren’t captured anywhere, you rely on memory and vibes—so the same pain repeats.

---

## Outcomes you can expect

- More consistent decision documentation (without over-documenting)
- Faster alignment with yourself or your team
- Fewer “gotchas” after committing
- Cleaner follow‑through and fewer loose ends
- Less decision fatigue over time

---

## Common use cases

(Use-case examples are intentionally high level.)

- Comparing commitments that seem “similar” on the surface
- Keeping track of recurring tradeoffs across projects
- Reducing rework and backtracking in client work
- Making scope, timelines, and constraints feel less fuzzy
- Building a simple weekly review habit for ongoing clarity
