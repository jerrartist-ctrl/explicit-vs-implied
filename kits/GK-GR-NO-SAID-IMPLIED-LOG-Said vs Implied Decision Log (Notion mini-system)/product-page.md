# Said vs Implied Decision Log — Notion Mini‑System

Ambiguous messages create expensive confusion: mismatched expectations, rework, and arguments about what was actually agreed to. Said vs Implied Decision Log is a Notion mini‑system designed to help you **document decisions with context** so projects stay aligned—even when communication is messy.

## The problem space (high level)

Most project communication happens in fragments: Slack threads, DMs, email chains, meeting notes, voice memos, comments on designs, and quick calls. In that environment, people often:

- interpret the same message differently
- assume approvals that were never explicitly given
- forget why a decision was made
- struggle to prove what was decided when conflict appears
- lose momentum because nobody knows the “current truth”

This creates **decision fog**: everyone is moving, but not in the same direction.

## Outcomes you’re aiming for

Without teaching any specific method, the outcomes this product supports are:

- clearer project agreements and fewer surprises
- less rework caused by unclear direction
- faster handoffs because context is easy to find
- stronger accountability (who decided what, when)
- cleaner boundaries between explicit statements and assumptions
- fewer “you never said that” cycles

## Common use cases

High-level only:

- client approvals and change requests
- product/engineering tradeoffs and decisions
