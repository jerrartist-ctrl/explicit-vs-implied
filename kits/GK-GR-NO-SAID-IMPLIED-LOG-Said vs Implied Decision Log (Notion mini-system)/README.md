# Said vs Implied Decision Log

Turn unclear messages into documented decisions—so teams, clients, and collaborators stop arguing about what was “meant” and start moving forward with confidence.

## Who it’s for

- Freelancers and agencies managing client feedback
- Product / ops teams coordinating across Slack, email, and meetings
- Founders juggling fast decisions and shifting priorities
- Anyone tired of “you never said that” confusion

## What problem this solves

When conversations move quickly, *meaning* gets lost. This system helps you reduce:

- “That’s not what I agreed to” disputes
- Rework caused by vague approvals
- Conflicting interpretations across stakeholders
- Decision drift (why did we choose this again?)
- Scope creep that starts as “just a quick thing”
- Missed expectations hidden in assumptions
