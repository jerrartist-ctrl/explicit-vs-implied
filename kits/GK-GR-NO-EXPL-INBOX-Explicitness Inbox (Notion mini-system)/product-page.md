## The problem (high level)
“Be explicit” is common feedback in writing, school, and work—but it’s often **too vague to act on**. Different people use the phrase to mean different things, so you can end up:
- Revising in circles
- Over-explaining the wrong parts
- Missing what reviewers actually wanted
- Losing context in long chat threads and scattered documents

The result is wasted time, inconsistent standards, and avoidable friction.

---

## Outcomes you can aim for
Without promising any one “right” style, this product is meant to support outcomes like:
- Clearer alignment on expectations
- Faster reviews and fewer revision loops
- Better handoffs and fewer misunderstandings
- More consistent clarity across documents and messages
- Decisions and context that remain searchable later

---

## Common use cases (high level only)
- Writing: essays, documentation, blog posts, proposals, instructions
- Work: product specs, internal memos, handoffs, meeting notes
- Collaboration: async feedback, peer review, editor/creator workflows
- Learning: turning “unclear” feedback into a clearer next move
