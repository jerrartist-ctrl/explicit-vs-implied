## Who it’s for
- Writers, students, and creators who get vague clarity feedback (“be explicit”, “more specific”, “add detail”) and need a consistent way to respond.
- Product/ops folks who want fewer misunderstandings in specs, handoffs, and async collaboration.
- Teams that want decisions and context to stay findable instead of living in chat threads.

---

## What problem this solves
When “be explicit” means something different to every person, you get:
- Rework from mismatched expectations
- Slow reviews and stalled approvals
- Conflicting feedback that’s hard to reconcile
- Lost context behind decisions (“why did we do it this way?”)
- Anxiety from unclear standards and moving goalposts
