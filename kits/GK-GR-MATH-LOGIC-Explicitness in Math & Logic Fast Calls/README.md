# Explicitness in Math & Logic: Fast Calls

Stop guessing what “be explicit” means in math and logic. This repo is a public teaser for a paid mini-product that helps you write and communicate with more precision **without over-explaining**.

## Who it’s for

- Students writing solutions, proofs, or explanations in math/logic-heavy courses  
- TAs/instructors who want consistent language for feedback like “be explicit”  
- Researchers and writers who need to state assumptions, definitions, and claims clearly  
- Anyone who keeps running into the word **explicit** (explicit formula, explicit construction, explicitly define, explicit solution, explicit bound…) and wants fewer misunderstandings

## What problem this solves

When people say “be explicit,” they often mean different things—leading to rewrites, unclear grading notes, and confusion in collaboration.

Common pain points this addresses:

- You get feedback like “be explicit” but don’t know what changed they want
- You don’t know how much detail is expected in a solution/proof
- You’re unsure how to phrase assumptions, definitions, or quantifiers cleanly
- You’re stuck between “too terse” and “too long”
- Your audience disagrees on what counts as an “explicit” statement (formula vs. construction vs. definability)
- You want clearer communication without turning every write-up into a textbook chapter

## What the full product includes (paid)

High-level only—no internal mechanics shown here.

- A compact guide to the **common meanings of “explicit”** across math and logic contexts  
- Language you can reuse to **set expectations** (for students, collaborators, or your future self)  
- A short reference you can keep nearby when writing solutions/proofs  
- A way to reduce ambiguity in: formulas, constructions, definitions, bounds, and statements of claims  
- Bonus material for educators/graders to make feedback more actionable (still non-formulaic and non-rubric)

## What’s *not* in this repo

This repo **does not** include the product itself.

- No method, steps, or “do X then Y” instructions
