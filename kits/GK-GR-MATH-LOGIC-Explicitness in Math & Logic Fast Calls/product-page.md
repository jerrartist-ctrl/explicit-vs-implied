# Explicitness in Math & Logic: Fast Calls — Product Overview (Public Teaser)

This page explains the **problem space** and the **outcomes** at a high level. It intentionally avoids teaching the underlying method or revealing internal decision logic.

## Why “explicit” causes confusion (in math & logic)

Across math and logic, the word **explicit** is used in multiple ways—often in the same course, paper, or conversation. People can mean different things by:

- “Give an explicit formula”
- “Make the definition explicit”
- “Be explicit about assumptions”
- “Provide an explicit construction”
- “State the constants explicitly”

That mismatch shows up as unclear feedback, conflicting expectations, and extra revision cycles—especially when the audience changes (student → TA → instructor → collaborator → reviewer).

## Outcomes you can expect (high level)

The paid version is designed to help you:

- Reduce ambiguity in your writing and communication
- Choose wording that matches what your audience likely expects
- Make definitions, assumptions, and claims easier to verify
- Keep solutions concise while still meeting “explicitness” expectations
- Avoid the common trap of over-explaining when clarity is the real goal

---

## Common use cases

High-level use cases (no examples or templates included here):

- Writing solutions for homework or exams
- Writing proofs or proof sketches for courses or research notes
- Tightening definitions and notation in drafts
- Clarifying assumptions and quantifiers in logic-heavy statements
- Communicating expectations when grading or giving feedback
- Aligning collaborators on what “explicit” means in a shared document

---

## What problem this solves

Specific pain points (not how-to):

- You’re told to “be explicit” and don’t know what to change
- You revise repeatedly because expectations are implicit or inconsistent
- You struggle to balance brevity with clarity
- You’re unsure whether “explicit” refers to a formula, a construction, a definitional choice, or a level of detail
- You want language that is precise without being pedantic
