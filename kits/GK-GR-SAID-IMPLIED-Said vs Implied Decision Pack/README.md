## Who it’s for

- People who keep hearing “be explicit” and need clarity without spiraling into long debates
- Teams communicating in chat/email where assumptions quietly cause rework or conflict
- Creators, operators, and customer-facing folks who want fewer “but I thought you meant…” moments
- Anyone who wants a consistent way to **reduce ambiguity** and **save the decision record**

---

## What problem this solves

Common pain points this helps with (without overexplaining or overpromising):

- “You didn’t say that” loops and retroactive reinterpretations
- Ambiguous wording that leads to mismatched expectations
- Disagreements about what was *implied* vs what was *actually stated*
- Rework caused by assumptions hiding inside short messages
- Stress from not knowing whether you’re being “explicit enough”
- Difficulty documenting decisions in a simple, repeatable way
