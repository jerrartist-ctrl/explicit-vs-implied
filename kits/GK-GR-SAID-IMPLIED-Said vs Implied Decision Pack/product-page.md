# Said vs Implied Decision Pack — Overview (Public)

This page is a high-level overview designed for discovery and search. It explains the **problem space** and the **outcomes** you can expect — without revealing the private framework, worksheets, or internal mechanics.

## The problem space

“Said vs implied” conflicts happen when people:
- assume shared context that isn’t actually shared,
- interpret short messages through different expectations,
- disagree about what was *stated* versus what was *inferred*,
- and then argue about *what should have been obvious*.

The cost is usually not the message itself — it’s the **rework**, **stress**, **trust damage**, and **time** spent trying to reconstruct meaning after the fact.

This product is for people who want:
- fewer looping conversations,
- clearer alignment,
- and an easy way to leave a clean decision trail.

## Outcomes (what you can expect)

At a high level, the full product helps you:

- Reduce ambiguity in written communication
- Make “explicit enough” feel more consistent (and less personal)
- Capture the key details so decisions don’t get rewritten later
- Cut down on back-and-forth and follow-up clarification loops
- Support calmer conversations when interpretations don’t match

---

## Common use cases (high level)

- Workplace chat/email alignment and handoffs  
- Customer support or community moderation clarity  
- Collaborative projects where expectations drift over time  
- Negotiations and agreements where wording matters  
- Product/engineering requirement interpretation and scope control  
- Personal boundaries and requests where “meaning” gets debated  

(Use cases are intentionally broad — this page avoids specific scenarios.)

## Where people usually look for help (search intent)

Query-style phrases that reflect real intent:

- “what does ‘be explicit’ mean in communication”
- “difference between implied and explicit meaning”
- “how to stop misunderstanding in texts”
- “people keep misinterpreting my messages”
- “how to write unambiguous instructions”
- “how to clarify assumptions”
- “how to document decisions in writing”
- “communication expectations mismatch”
- “what counts as an explicit agreement”
- “how to prevent miscommunication in teams”
- “how to reduce back and forth in email”
- “why do people assume things I didn’t say”
- “how to avoid scope creep from vague messages”
- “how to get alignment in async communication”
- “interpretation differences in written communication”
- “how to handle ‘that’s not what I meant’ conversations”
