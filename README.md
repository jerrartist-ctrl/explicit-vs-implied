# Public Preview Kits

Welcome — this repository is a **public preview hub** for a set of kits that help reduce ambiguity, surface assumptions, and make decisions/terms/costs more explicit.

These are **preview versions** (lightweight + shareable) meant to show:
- structure
- scope
- clarity of the method
- example formatting

If you’re looking for the full versions, you’ll find links in each kit’s folder.
